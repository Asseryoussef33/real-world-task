## ðŸ“Š Data Mining Project

This project demonstrates a complete data mining pipeline using a combination of classification and clustering methods. The key steps include:

* **Data Loading**: Importing and inspecting the dataset.
* **Preprocessing**: Applying normalization techniques to prepare data for analysis.
* **Modeling**:

  * **Decision Tree Classifier**: Used for supervised learning to predict categorical outcomes.
  * **K-Means Clustering**: Applied for unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings in the data.
* **Evaluation**: Model performance assessed using appropriate metrics.
* **Visualization**: Effective plots and charts were used to support data understanding and model interpretation.
* **Recommendations**: Insights and suggestions derived from the data analysis.
